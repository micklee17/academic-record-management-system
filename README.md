## Problems to be fixed
1. Phone number could not be added to personal information correctly
2. Email could not be added to personal information correctly.
3. Users can set their username despite it is not their correct username (i.e., A studentID of a student is 12345, but he/she can set the login username to 13456).
4. Query/Add course is only available for using username.
5. Programme name might be displayed wrongly sometimes.
